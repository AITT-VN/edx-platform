# The XModule subsystem contains various legacy (yet mission-critical) features
# such as ModuleStore, the LMS & CMS XBlock runtimes, and several common block types.
# It is semi-intertwined with the `openedx`, `common`, and `lms` packages. However,
# it is mostly independent from the CMS, which is something we'd like to preserve.
